How to adopt the skeleton in an existing repo
=============================================

If you have an existing repo and would like to adopt the skeleton structure
then you can use the commandline tool to merge the skeleton into your repo::

    dls-python3-skeleton existing /path/to/existing/repo

This will:

- Take the repo name from the last element of the path
- Take the package name from the repo name unless overridden by ``--package``
- Clone the existing repo in /tmp
- Create a new orphan merge branch from the skeleton repo
- Create a single commit that modifies the skeleton with the repo and package name
- Push that merge branch back to the existing repo
- Merge with the currently checked out branch, leaving you to fix the conflicts

.. note::

    If you installed the commandline tool in a virtualenv, be sure to run
    ``deactivate`` when you have finished running it, otherwise ``pipenv
    install`` will use your virtualenv rather than making its own

Example merge
-------------

As an example, `scanspec #46
<https://github.com/dls-controls/scanspec/pull/46>`_ shows the what this
adoption looks like. The commandline tool was run on the existing repo::

    $ cd /path/to/scanspec
    $ git checkout -b adopt-skeleton
    Switched to a new branch 'adopt-skeleton'
    $ dls-python3-skeleton existing .

    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

    Please fix the conflicts above, then you can run:
        git branch -d skeleton-merge-branch
    Instructions on how to develop this module are in CONTRIBUTING.rst

First of the boilerplate files were removed::

    $ git rm src/scanspec/hello.py docs/images/dls-logo.svg docs/images/dls-favicon.ico docs/how-to/accomplish-a-task.rst docs/explanations/why-is-something-so.rst -f
    rm 'docs/explanations/why-is-something-so.rst'
    rm 'docs/how-to/accomplish-a-task.rst'
    rm 'docs/images/dls-favicon.ico'
    rm 'docs/images/dls-logo.svg'
    rm 'src/scanspec/hello.py'

Then the merge conflicts were fixed, and the pipenv dependencies updated::

    $ pipenv --rm
    $ rm Pipfile.lock
    $ pipenv install --dev

The tests and docs were then run and checked::

    $ pipenv run tests
    $ pipenv run docs

Finally the results were committed, pushed, merged to master::

    $ git commit
    $ git push github adopt-skeleton
