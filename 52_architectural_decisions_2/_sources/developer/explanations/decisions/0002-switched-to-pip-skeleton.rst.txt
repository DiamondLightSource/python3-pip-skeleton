Status

Accepted

Context
-------

We should use the diamond light source `python pip skeleton <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python3-pip-skeleton>`_.
The skeleton is used across diamond to ensure consitency in developer environments and package management.

Decision
--------

We have switched to using the skeleton.

Consequences
------------

The developer environment may have changed, the following could be different:
* linting
* formatting
* pip env setup
* CI/CD
