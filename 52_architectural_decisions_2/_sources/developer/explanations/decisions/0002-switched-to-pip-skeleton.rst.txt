2. Started using the the dls python skeleton
============================================

Date: 2022-02-18

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

We should use the diamond light source `python3-pip-skeleton <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python3-pip-skeleton>`_.
The skeleton is used across diamond to ensure consitency in developer environments and package management.

Decision
--------

We have switched to using the skeleton.

Consequences
------------

This module will use a fixed set of tools as developed in python3-pip-skeleton and can pull from this skeleton to update the packaging to the latest techniques.

As such, the developer environment may have changed, the following could be different:
* linting
* formatting
* pip venv setup
* CI/CD
